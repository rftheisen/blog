# Emerging Technology Predictions

Below are my notes on various sectors and the key companies and technologies that will revolutionize the way humanity operates. This is a constant work in progress so it will likely never be completed, only ever reaching temporary finished states.&#x20;

* People evolve... so to do their tools
* Good technology is multi-functional
* Software, AI, Automation and Robotics will be the key technologies of the future

### Transportation  & Logistics

* Getting from point A to Point B
* We used run, ride horses and pull carriages&#x20;
* Roads, Highways and Interstate systems have evolved based on the medium we travel
* Water, Ground and Air are the natural mediums for travel
* The steam engine was a major milestone&#x20;
* Combustion engines on a chassis and wheels (Ford Motor Company)&#x20;
* Engines just got better over time. More horsepower, faster and could pull more weight
* Not just transporting people, your transporting goods&#x20;
* Why do we still use boats?&#x20;
  * Can they carry more?&#x20;
  * Are they faster?&#x20;
* Fuel... how do we fuel our transportation?&#x20;
