# Learning Goals for 2025-2026📚

It is important to write your goals down. For me writing is an essential part of my learning and growth process. It is how I track and record what I've actually done, want and feel called to do.&#x20;

Below are my current goals that I am actively working towards:



1. Finish creating A Beginners Guilde to Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking wit Hack The Box on YouTube

2. Finish creating Practical Network Fundamentals on YouTube

3. Finish writing my entry level computing course

### Strategy to Accomplish Goals



1. Make two or more videos a week
2. Make two or more videos a week&#x20;
3. Write 2 sections a week



I used to write down as many goals as I could, but over the years I have found that to be counterproductive. It is better for me to have fewer goals and actually accomplish them, then to have lots of goals and not accomplish any. Ill add more goals after I accomplish the ones I have above.&#x20;
