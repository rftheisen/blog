# Get a Starborn Ship early in Starfield (PC)

Have you reached the point in Starfield where you have encountered Starborn?&#x20;

If you are anything like me I am sure this made you curious, especially if you have seen their awesome ships. There is an easy way to acquire one of these ships early in the game however, you have to use console commands.&#x20;

### A Brief Note on Using Console Commands in Games

There's no shame in using console commands, the devs built-in the ability for gamers to use the console for a reason. That said, I do understand the concerns that some may have regarding using  console commands instead of earning the ship through good ole fashioned video game hard work :). I personally think the console adds a whole new element of fun to games and even scratches that curious part of my mind that loves to tinker with tech (specifically software). The console is a developer console meant for game developers and modders to manipulate the game. In this case we are going to spawn a Starborn Ship IV on the player's position, unlock it and claim it as our own.&#x20;



Lets get started.



### 1. Fast Travel to the Surface of a Planet



Fast travel to the surface of a planet and walk/run to an open field. I chose to fast travel to the industrial outpost on Jemison.

Once you have done that click the tilde key **\~.** The tilde key will open the developer console.&#x20;

You will notice a transparent black screen surface from the bottom of your display.&#x20;

Note that using the console command for some actions may disable achievements. This console is similar to the console that your favorite web browser has that allows you to inspect the elements of a web page.&#x20;



Now lets spawn that beautiful piece of extraterrestrial machinery.&#x20;



### 2. Spawn the Starborn Ship IV

In your console type the following to spawn the ship:&#x20;

```
player.placeatme 363ca9
```

You will have to exit the console for this to take effect, so click the tilde **\~** key again.&#x20;

It will likely spawn you awkwardly inside of the ship and perhaps even slightly underneath the map. Try using your jet pack to boost your way out and find the door.&#x20;

The door looks like the sky does at night.

Keep in mind that if you have not beaten the game, the door may say \[Inaccessible]. Fear not for we have the power of the almighty developer console to make this inaccessible door.... accessible.&#x20;



### 3. Make the \[Inaccessible door, Accessible] using the developer console

This step may seem tricky at first but it is not. Keep in mind that most things you look at in Starfield are objects that are part of a program, have states, and functions that can be manipulated through the console. We want to **unlock** the door. Open the console and point with your mouse just below the door frame. You may have to click your mouse to make sure the door object is selected, then type **unlock** in the console. This should change the door to an unlocked state.&#x20;

Boom! Now you have an incredible ship.&#x20;



It can travel at the speed up light, has incredibly powerful weapons and turns invisible when boosters are engaged.&#x20;



Enjoy!&#x20;
