# Welcome to Bob Theisen's Blog💙

Welcome to my ever changing website! You'll find that this site is built for learning, exploration and empowerment. You should find something here that will do all three for you. I'm Bob (also known online as LTNBOB), the author of this site and I am called by God to empower others through innovative educational experiences. I believe that we are not talking enough about the quality of education. Seeking an education can be one of the most empowering things a person can do for themselves. It can lift you into realms you never dreamt of. Whether you are seeking informal educational pathways or enrolled in college you should demand a quality experience. The journey towards a credential should be full of enriching experiences. In Information Technology the experiences should lead to relevant/highly sought after skills and unique opportunities. Too many colleges are teaching out-of-date curriculum. This is unacceptable for the cost to be so high, at least thats the case here in the USA. Part of my calling is to change this by partnering with learner focused institutions, teams and individuals to address the skills gap in tech. The fact that you are here is an indicator that you are interested in learning more about Cybersecurity, Networking and or Systems administration. Perhaps even, my community-focused Twitch show [Hack\&Secure](https://www.twitch.tv/ltn_bob), [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeV-vJZ2gydVsfLuJjGTuyQ/about?view_as=subscriber), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/robertftheisen) or one of my friends steered you in this direction.&#x20;
