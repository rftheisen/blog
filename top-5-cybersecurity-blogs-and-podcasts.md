<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A Jedi Reading and Listening to Podcasts - Made with Midjourney</p></figcaption></figure>

Blogs & Podcasts are effective short form ways of learning topics and gaining unique insight & perspectives. I personally read blogs and listen to podcasts daily. In this blog post I'm sharing my personal favorite Cybersecurity blogs & podcasts. While I am ranking these in an ordered list, my top favorites constantly change based on **authenticity**, **perspective gained,** **inspiration** and **production quality**.

### Top 5 Cybersecurity Blogs

#### 1. The DFIR Report

The DFIR Report is a series of blog posts that cover real intrusions that happen in enterprise network environments. The identity of the breached companies are never shared but the attackers actions are covered in great detail and mapped to the [MITRE ATT\&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/). At the bottom of each post are some helpful Yara rules sets and specific Tactic & Technique mappings. Each post reads like a camp fire story that a DFIR Analyst is telling. It has great offensive and defensive perspective.



#### 2. Hack The Box's Blog

Hack The Box's blog is phenomenal. It provides unique insight on how individuals and organizations are using Hack The Box to upskill. The blog also provides insights from industry experts in the form of:

* Top Hacking Tool Lists
* Stories from the Industry
* Career Tips & Journeys
* CTF Walkthroughs
* Learning & Topic Guides
* General Overview of the Cybersecurity industry and immerging trends

#### 3. Daniel Miessler's Blog

Daniel Miessler is a thought leader in Infosec. I like his blog because it reads like he is sitting next to you explaining everything in a practical way. He mostly covers topics in Infosec but also includes some helpful motivational tips and insights on life in general. His podcast and Newsletter called Unsupervised Learning is included on my top podcasts list later in this post.&#x20;



#### 4. Security Soup

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (32).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Security Soup is essentially a series of curated lists that link to recent attacks & breaches, new tools & techniques, industry news and emerging security research. Each post is a weekly round up that organizes all the resources with accompanying links. Its honestly great and can provide you with enough learning to last you well beyond a week.&#x20;



#### 5. 0xdf Hack's Stuff

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (70).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% embed url="https://0xdf.gitlab.io/" %}

0xdf is a Cybersecurity content creator that is world renowned for his work at Hack The Box. His blog mostly includes highly detailed & educational walkthroughs of retired Hack The Box boxes. Each post highlights tools and techniques with enough explanation to reproduce. When I first started learning on Hack The Box I started with retired machines because they have walkthroughs available and I'd often default to 0xdf's blog to help me through boxes and to really understand what I was doing. Each post is fantastic and full of learning opportunities.&#x20;

### Top 5 Cybersecurity Podcasts/Webcasts

#### 1. Darknet Diaries

Darknet Diaries is incredible. In each episode Jack Rhysider (show creator) interviews an interesting person on the Infosec scene. He provides narration and explanation but what really makes the show engaging in my opinion is the excellent production quality. All interviews flow like it is story time and will have you on the edge of your seat as many of the interviewees tell their exciting stories. Honestly this is a **MUST LISTEN** for any one interested in IT, Cybersecurity and/or Software Development.&#x20;

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (35).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Unsupervised Learning is a unique show created by Daniel Miessler. It is essentially the Security Soup of podcasts where Daniel briefly summarizes what is happening in Infosec, Tech as a whole and how all this seems to fit in society. Each episode has a great pace, lots of value and is relatively quick. It is fantastic.

#### 3. Blueprint

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (89).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% embed url="https://www.sans.org/podcasts/blueprint/" %}

Blueprint is a defensive focused podcast where SANS Instructor & Defensive Cybersecurity professional John Hubbard brings on guests from the Blue Team side of Cybersecurity. Many of the guests manage or are senior in a SOC environment. I like this podcast because it is one of the few consistent podcasts out there that are focused on defense. Lots of content available is built around hacking, red teaming and pentesting, which is understandable because it's fun and exciting but having Blueprint really helps shine light on the importance of playing good defense.&#x20;



#### 4. Black Hills Information Security

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (41).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I still can't believe BHIS gives away content like this for free. BHIS's webcasts on their YouTube are like the Ivy league of instructor led content in Cybersecurity. Each video is essentially a well prepared lesson that guides viewers/listeners to an understanding of the topic. John Strand is one of the Infosec GOATs and a world-class educator. The content is easily bingeable.&#x20;



#### 5. Hack The Box&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/c/HackTheBox/videos" %}

In my opinion Hack The Box is the best Cybersecurity training company in the industry. Most of their content is designed to be interacted with in a lab environment accessible via VPN and through their websites, which is essential for truly developing skills and abilities.

{% embed url="https://academy.hackthebox.com/" %}

However, since this is a blog post about blogs and podcasts/webcasts I'm ranking them here because they also happen to have excellent content on their YouTube channel & podcast. The content on their YouTube channel is very well produced and recorded during live community events & CTFs. The content is always educational and hands-on. One of my personal favorites that they recently posted is the video Pivoting, Attacking The "Unreachable Network" by PlainText & r0adrunn3r

Please know these are just some of my personal favorite blogs and podcasts/webcasts available for free online in 2022. If you know of any that others would benefit from, feel free to reach out to me, Ill check it out and maybe add it to the post. You could even create a list of your own on your blog to help others. Thanks for reading this and keep learning!
